		<p><span>Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress, mid December 2021 before Xmas rush, 1 paid night, got an Executive Suite without asking. (Thread closed)<p>

Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress, January 2022, 3 paid nights, initially assigned to a King room on 18th floor, but we arrived early so they offered a 8th floor lake view room.  Since we were just dropping off bags before going to the park, I asked if there will be a suite available later and got an Executive Suite at 1:16pm via text.</p><p>

No free parking on paid night even with lifetime status.  One of these days, we will logged enough visits here to get free parking on paid nights that other Diamonds/Globs received. </p></span></p>

		<div><p>Disregard I guess. Room changed back to a premium room. It will be a late arrival to the hotel so I�ll ask when I get there but I�ve never been preupgraded just to have it pulled later. That�s a new one.</p><p>

Edit: massive line of people ahead of me at 11:30pm and by time I got to the line I didn�t push anything I just wanted a room to sleep. I�ll probably ask in the morning about what happened but I�m sure I�ll get something along the lines of upgrades are based on availability. Still a strange thing to happen.</p></div>

		<p>Big thumbs down (again) for the HR Reston.  Pre-assigned to a "club level" room which makes no difference as club is closed.  Had to call to even get assigned a corner room which is their best standard room.  Upon arrival, noticed standard suite in app.  Once again, not actually available.  They did manage to find something, but it had 2x twin bed connecting instead of a King which I turned down (this is not even an option on the website) and if I had accepted, they said I couldn't have late checkout (not that I would have needed it).  15 minutes after getting to my room and having already unpacked, got a call from the front desk that somehow a suite became available (doubtful that it wasn't initially there).  Declined.  Repeat guest with prior emails with management at the hotel about this very issue.  Nothing has changed</p>

Manager acknowledged in post-checkout email exchange that this was a terrible Globalist room assignment and should never have happened.  But no service recovery at all.</p><p>

Hyatt Regency Minneapolis (this week)<br>
Booked: basic king, cheap<br>
Received: unsure what kind of suite, but it's bigger than my flat. Bedroom looks to be a basic king room attached to a huge living room with dinner seating for six and a gigantic nice new LG TV. Zero food options here other than what's on offer at "The Market" shop and obvs the lounge is closed. Hey there's always Doordash and the Nicollet Mall restaurants are a short walk (just avoid Brit's Pub, blech) if the weather isn't kill-you cold, which it'll be by Thursday.</p></span></p>

</div><p>Me too. I have had to ask every single stay, no upgrades at all before I am standing before them. However once I ask, I've gotten one suite (<b>Hyatt Regency Miami</b>), 2 club level upgrades with views (<b>Grand Hyatt SF</b>), and one nothing burger (<b>Confidante Miami Beach</b>). Annoying I have to ask every time and nothing is done before I appear.</p></div>

</div><p>My general experience is that the hotel will do upgrades of the same type relatively automatically, but they don't change bed types.  Did you book the 2Q with dumpster view?  Sure, they upgrade you to a nicer floor 2Q.  But they generally won't change the bed types because it's safer to assume people picked a certain bed type.  </p><p>

Also, even if you book the 1K, they'll upgrade to a higher/nicer room, but typically won't upgrade to a suite unless asked.  </p><p>

I've found that doing online check-in and then directly calling the hotel to explain what you want is frequently helpful.  And then at check-in if there's rooms of the type that I want available and they haven't upgraded me to it I ask.</p></div>

</div><p>Korean GH Hyatts seem to be turning into "you get what you've booked" but YMMV. At least that's been my experience at my last 2 GH Seoul and Incheon stays. I tried asking and got shot down both times by the front desk and duty manager. There was availability for better rooms and suites but they wanted to sell them (and were quite explicit about that fact). Tough luck for me but I would still ask nicely in other places and hope for the best!</p></div>

Only benefit I've seen so far is nice included breakfasts... which clearly beat Hilton's new nonsensical f&amp;b credit and match Marriott's generally.</p>
		
		<hr>
	</div>
</div><p>Yeah same.  1 suite upgrade here and another that was given and pulled after online checkin later in the day.  I imagine the globalist pool is quite large at the moment and I'm just not at the top of the upgrade chain.  I have a lot of travel planned so I'm going to aim for the suite upgrades that way I won't have to rely on hoping for the best if it's a stay I would want one.  Hyatt is alright but so far it hasn't been nearly as good as I thought it would be coming from Hilton.</p></div>

Confidante Miami Beach (3 nights, certificates) - Checked in at 6 pm and given a basic OV king room, told to come back down first thing in the morning and they would upgrade me. Given an OV Balcony Suite for final two nights. <br>
PH New York (3 nights, points/certificates) - Park View King on the 15th floor I believe, suites showed sold out days in advance<br>
Gild Hall (1 night, certificate) - King Bed Premium<br>
Anadaz Mayokaba (5 nights, prive) - Used TSU and received a beach area suite<br>
Mission Pacific (4 nights, points) - Used a TSU and received an Bohemian Suite<br>
HR Houston Galleria (2 night, cash) - Booked a base king and received a Regency Suite<br>
HR DFW - (1 night, cash) - Booked a base king and received a Executive Suite<br>
Andaz Maui (3 nights, points) - Used a TSU and received an upgrade to an OV Suite<br>
HR Maui (3 nights, points) - Emailed VIP manager before arrival and asked for an upgrade if possible, given an amazing Deluxe Ocean Front Suite.</p></div>

Tempe Mission Palms - 2 night stay arrived at 11pm.  Suites showing earlier in the day but gone by time i got there.  Booked a base king received a corner king.<br>
HR LAX - 1 night stay arriving around 9pm.  Suites also available earlier but also gone by time I got there.  Booked base king received a high floor city view.  I did get $50 credit for arriving after the happy hour was over which was nice but I couldn't spend it all.<br>
HR Waikiki - 3 night stay upgraded 2 days prior to an oceanfront room from a base room.  No suites showing available but from what I've read that property doesn't have many.</p></div>

Asked at desk about suite being available, agent said "they weren't earlier in the day when she checked", I said 'politley', they did show as available a couple of hours ago. After a few minutes she confirmed one was available but is not ready (2pm). I accepted the wait, went for a late lunch and recieved a text confirming my room was ready at 3.15pm.</p><p>

Nice executive suite at the end of floor 7.</p></div>

Only reason I choose this over other local Hyatt's is the decent food at Capital Grill, including Glob breakfast.

		<div><p>Hyatt Regency, Manchester, UK<br>
Booked standard King using points (great vlaue for &gt;$250 room rate)<br>
Upon checking in advised I'd been 'upgrade' to Club Access King (woo hoooooo = sarcasm). I mentioned the Regency Suite showed as being available earlier in the day, the agent said it wasn't now. The desk 'manager' to the side of us overhead the conversation and said 'let me check'. She then confirmed it was available and I would be allocated that room. Was available for $650 that night :D</p><p>

More and more, I think us Globalists that haven't established a relationship with a property, just need to be well prepared to 'discuss' suite availability when checking in, to ensure we have a fair chance of getting the benefits we've earned. Otherwise, we'll just get what's in the best interests of the property.</p><p>

Other than this, the property is GREAT and VERY WELL RUN, with a PROPER HYATT breakfast service !</p></div>

Proactively upgraded in app before check in to...I forgot the exact name, but a large executive suite of some kind. It was nice and very large, but the decor made it feel "empty" somehow. All the requisite furniture was there, but the room was lacking some sort of "soul". Still very pleased though, especially with the proactive suite upgrade.</p>

</div><p>This seems to be the way for several Korean Hyatts too.  They want to keep nicer rooms for sale as long as possible than giving it to a Globalist and having to clean it.  A precise, strongly worded email to Consumer Affairs can be helpful in cases like this.</p></div>

</div><p>Hotel management/staff attempting to gaslight loyal customers? Can't say I'm surprised by it. I've heard various upgrade-denying excuses from so many different properties and brands across hotel groups that it seems like the industry staff are trained to parrot certain lines to try to deny the upgrades that are due under the hotel program terms and conditions.   Often I wouldn't even care if they upgrade me or not, but at least be honest with me about their preference to not provide the complimentary upgrade due whatever the real reason is for their refusal to stick to program terms applicable to upgrade benefits.</p><p>

Some hotel groups and hotels are worse about this than others; and some hotel management and employees are worse about this than others even within the same organization/property.  Hyatt is usually on the better end of this stuff in the industry. But as some diseases in the industry just spread and spread, it can be risky to count on what was counted on before with hotels honoring the benefits as required under the program terms and conditions sold to customers.</p></div>

I'm planning to stay a night or two at GH Seoul in May. It will definitely be over the weekend, and it will be a Globalist Guest of Honor booking, using 15k Hyatt pts. I'm hoping to get upgraded to a suite<br>
Thanks. I appreciate your feedback.</p>

</div><p>Yeah I now realize that this was only possible for me because I stayed during the weekdays. I used my cat 1-4 free nights at the GH Seoul. I did not email them in advance.</p></div>

Called hotel to ask about upgrades for globalists and was told they upgrade to the Deluxe King Room only as that has been classified by the hotel as a "suite". It is listed under their webpage as a suite as well. Demanded they cancel my reservation as that kind of scam is total BS. Not going to give a hotel my business that classifies as standard room as a suite to get around globalist upgrades.</p></div>

		<p>Globalist just checked in to PH in north america last night for 4 night leisure stay. Checked in week leading up to stay, multiple varieties of standard suite available to book for my dates so did not use suite upgrade award. On app morning of check in was upgraded to king deluxe high floor (not suite). On arrival to hotel 7 pm still able to book multiple types of standard suite. Not offered, requested suite and particularly with soaker tub (one type of standard suite has them, other does not). Told only accessible suite is available with soaker tub. Pushed back gently ("really? website looks like you have other standard suites available") but got a firm "no." Spouse was uncomfortable and made moves to accept so I acquiesced. This morning appears all kinds of standard suites STILL available. WWFTD? Leave it be? Our room is fine, accessible shower not my favorite but we do have the tub. NO view (mechanicals only, which FDA revealed when room offered). Any of the standard suites would be bigger...not sure about views.<br>
Would globalist phone line help?</p>

I DM'd hyatt concierge via Twitter, but don't think my honey will want to move at this point, more looking for how to proceed in the future. Thanks!<br>
Update: reached out to hyatt concierge via DM on twitter and they did offer to contact management and help. Before I got that message I tried to take a shower and found only lukewarm water, so went to front desk to inquire about a different room and mentioned the convo from last night. Agent this morning apologized "for the miscommunication" and put us directly into the corner 1 bedroom suite with soaker tub (as I requested). Standard suite but the larger of the two and with the tub, this one has a view, too. All better!! ;)</p></div>

		<p>Booked a 1K accessible for 8k points since it was all that was available. Messaged them 2 days prior asking for a regular room since I don�t need the accessible and found out they put me in a view king room. Night before arriving noticed they were playing with my reservation and had 1 view room and 1 jr suite booked. An hour later it was cleaned up and settled into the vip suite. I don�t think they have a bigger suite. Checked in online once available and will go claim it later today. Room is going for $600 per night so that�s a pretty good value for points.</p>

</div><p>It is my understanding that the Healthcare rates give you the same pricing as Friends and Family rates, but are eligible rates in terms of benefits. Since I have never used Hyatt employee friends/family rates, so cannot speak to those.</p></div>

</div><p>Lucky! I tried booking for my parents when they had a flight issue at DFW. When I checked around 5pm I <i>think </i>there was points availability. Then when I went to book around 530p hotel was sold out. Kind of a cascading effect with all the nearby Hyatts...as I checked each one, availability began disappearing minutes later after talking to my parents. They ended up on a waitlist at the HR and finally just after midnight they were given a room. ~$215++ in the end. And of course no upgrade possible.</p></div>

</div><p>Yeah, this place was really busy. I wasn't sure if I could arrive at DFW on the same day so didn't make a reservation till the last minute. I checked it on Orbitz and other 3rd party sites, and their inventories were gone in the morning, but the price on Hyatt.com was like $250 and award/points stay was available. I didn't expect an upgrade, but I was asked if I wanted to get any suite at check-in.</p></div>

		<p>We had a good staycation at The Shay.  Our room on the 5th floor facing the metro tracks and the noise pollution was minimal.  Bed was comfy and fortunately for us, no signs of bed bugs. The deep soaking tub in the bathroom was a nice touch.  For dinner we dined at Etta which is located inside the hotel. It was the most memorable meal I had so far in 2022! Globalist breakfast options are limited but quality was good.  Didn't have a chance to check out the roof top pool but we will probably revist the hotel sometime in the near future</p>

		<div><p>GH - Kuala Lumpur<br>
King Deluxe to Grand Exec Suite - very nice corner suite</p><p>

GH - Jakarta<br>
King Deluxe to Grand Suite - have to say I am a bit disappointed. First time back in Jakarta since pre-pandemic. They have renovated the rooms, but something is just off with them. </p><p>

Note - in both cases the suite was not given on arrival. In the case of KL, I understood as I arrived during the Eid holiday. The hotel was quite busy and suites showed sold out. After 2 days the holiday folks cleared out and they promptly upgraded our room to the excellent Exec Suite. The Grand Club also re-opened after 2 years and the staff there was very attentive.</p><p>

For Jakarta however, it was different. Suites showed available, however on check-in (at the window marked WoH) the person doing the check-in made no mention of upgrade (he seemed to maybe not even know about Glob benefits...it was strange). So I inquired and he went and got the FDM on-duty. He told me they couldn't upgrade because "rooms are getting full now". When I had checked earlier in the day, they showed suites open the entire length of my stay (10 days) - but then after checking in I looked again and they were gone. Not sure what happened there...just got the feeling they were reluctant to upg for the full length of the stay (10 days). Hotel doesn't appear to be that busy - it looks like some floors may still be closed down (either for renov or just not fully open the building).<br>
So I re-inquired after the weekend, and was still put off with vague excuse. So I got my concierge involved and "boom" magically a suite appeared. I saw in the GH - Jakarta main thread that one Glob had rec'd recent upgrade to the new Capital Suite, but we rec'd only standard Grand Suite (yes, that is all it is supposed to be...). Grand Club still not open here, but they are giving nice benefits for afternoon tea &amp; evening service at either Fountain lounge or Grand Cafe.</p></div>

This seems to be the standard for me unless I can find Family Suite availability and use an upgrade certificate to secure this.  No free suite and nothing better than a Family Suite when using certs.  Not a complaint, we do enjoy this hotel for their value as a Diamond.</p></div>

At checkin the room wasn�t ready and the front desk asked the manager for another room and they chatted in the back for a minute only to return and saying I could have another room but it was a lower category room. Pretty sure he denied her moving me to a nicer suite but that�s the way it goes sometimes.</p>

I'm guessing there are 7 of these suites in this hotel. It felt really spacious because of the 12 ft. high ceilings.</p><p>

It would be nice if you get at least one of them upgrading to the suite, but if not you might want to ask for 1kg Hollywood Hills View "Deluxe" which also has 12 foot high ceilings and 270 sqf.</p></div>

Hyatt Centric magnificent Mile - 2 nights base king upgraded to an executive suite the day before arrival. Room available when I did app checkin at 8am. At first it said my upgraded room wasn�t available until 3 and I could have another that was available immediately but once I completed checkin I got my digital key. </p><p>

Had both of these rooms on a trip with the exact same stay pattern several months back and got the same upgrades. Quite happy. It�s been a really good first full year with Hyatt for suite upgrades. I�d say about half of the time I�ve got a suite and all but a couple of times I�ve got a solid upgrade otherwise.</p></div>

</div><p>Im globalist lite still technically. I still had a few upgrades last year and I had maybe 15 nights. I got it with double tier and the credit card. Currently sitting at 59 nights and have been upgraded to a suite half the time. I can count on one hand the times I haven�t been upgraded and it�s usually expected.</p><div>

</div><p>I too am Globalist for the first time this year (I guess "lite" if that's a real thing). I have had very mixed results. On three stays, I have been upgraded to a suite in advance. The interesting thing with those stays--all 3 were labeled as premium suites (Grand Hyatt Bogota, Hyatt Regency CDG, Andaz Prague).

With most of my other stays, I have been proactive about requesting suite upgrades. If I am invited to check in online, and I see that standard suites are available with no upgrade showing in the app, I will contact the hotel (via text or email) asking if they will upgrade me, and it has usually worked (Centric Waikiki, Andaz Scottsdale, Regency Bloomington MN, Grand Hyatt San Antonio). Not sure if I would have been upgraded at any of these hotels without being proactive. I once texted and was told there wasn't a suite available, but pushed back because it was still listed and they upgraded me (Thompson DC). At 2 hotels (Centric Chicago Mag Mile and Regency Paris Etoile) I asked at check-in when I saw one available in the app, got some push back but they gave us the suite. I think there have been 3 stays where no standard suites were available, and I received the best non-suite room available without asking. So since becoming Globalist, I guess I have had suite upgrades on 10/13 stays, and all stays where one was available at check-in (but I definitely asked a bunch of times).</p></div>

</div><p>I�d say this is a very successful Globalist upgrade list! In this game, it�s unfortunate you won�t always get what you don�t ask for, but even then, Hyatt far outpaces the competition where they will consistently give you nothing even if you ask.</p><p>

Hotels are not often owned by the chain brands and will try their best to protect their abilities to sell suites for cash - it�s up to you to know what you are entitled to.</p></div>

		<div><p>Just this last weekend, when we checked in at our hotel, they gave us one of the possibly worst rooms in the property (it only had a window to the gallery, directly above the bar). Upon checking in, they explicitly told us to apologize that they had 'no upgrades available". I was particularly frustrated because 30 mins before our check-in I checked on the website and they were still selling standard suites (i.e. I was banging myself against the wall for not being more proactive and not calling / testing them when earlier in the morning I saw on the app we had not been upgraded). </p><p>

After seeing what the room looked like, we went back to the lobby and asked whether they'd have any other rooms available. The lady at the reception was kind enough to come and personally show us 2 other rooms -that were a LOT better, bigger, quieter, and with a normal window. Why they wouldn't give a Globalist one of those rooms from the onset is a mystery to me-. After we decided to settle for the second room she showed us, I politely asked her what the best strategy to score an upgrade would have been as I explained I saw they had standard suites available earlier in the day. She said "oh, let me see if there are any suites available starting tomorrow and get back to you, you might be able to change rooms tomorrow". She came back 5 minutes later, and she gave us the keys to a MASSIVE <b><u>premium</u></b> suite. She said that "someone that booked that suite did a no-show" (at 5pm.... ? lol).</p><p>


I am certainly not complaining about the outcome, but as I told my atheist partner, God works in mysterious ways....</p></div>

I reached out to Hyatt who said they could refund the points and TSU then cancel the stay without penalty.</p><p>

The only other nearby Hyatt House in the same Category  is very old and has many complaints otherwise I�d switch to there.</p><p>

It�s a difficult situation as the room right next to ours has maybe 6 people in it and they�ve been smoking marijuana outside the front door of their (5 feet from ours) all day in and out.</p></div>

</div><p>I may be wrong but I�m guessing that the majority of their award rooms are booked for prospective stays due to the location and pricing then cancelled a week out or less. Leading to there being basically no availability unless you�re booking a week or less out.</p><p>

That�s just my guess and what I�ve seen when I�ve checked 1-12 months out vs. 1 day to 7 days out.</p><p>

It�s a good strategy especially if you find Off Peak dates, but damn it sucks for those hoping to stay in San Diego and booking travel plans around it.</p></div>

For the $50 credit it�s a suburban Hyatt House so nothing really to use that on, other than toiletries, chips or candy bars.</p><p>

<li>1 stay there was a standard suite showing and I do believe the agents genuinely tried to get me into it, but they eventually said they could not and that even though it was showing on the app, they were all already internally blocked. They even tried to get me into the suite on night 2, when it was showing available again, and then eventually the same issue. I'll note that the suite availability in the app was constantly in flux so it seemed a bit wonky.</li>
<li>The other 6 stays no upgrade received as there were no standard suites available. </li>

I should correct that I did get one suite upgrade, but that's because I traveled with a friend and we each booked a night. He asked for a suite upgrade in advance so we got to keep the room for my night. Not sure if that really counts though.</p></div>

		<p>0 upgrades to suites so far as a first time Globalist (“Lite” ?) &amp; one very disappointing stay in Hawaii. Ironically, I’ve had better upgrades, including suite upgrades, at Marriott where I’m a lowly Gold. One of the reasons I’ve shifted most of my future stays to Marriott + Marriott simply has a much better footprint generally, at least to places I generally travel.</p>

Booked executive suite €618 p/n<br>
got upgraded in app to Art Suite Terrace<br>
arrived at hotel and got upgraded to highest catagory room type: 2 bedroom Wellem Suite €1348 p/n</p><p>

no idea why,<br>
but hotel seems sold out because of Christmas markets (Weihnachtsmarckte)<br>
guess my standard suite was needed to please a globalist and i got bumped because i paid an expensive rate?<br>
or that there were many globalists redeeming that they ran out of standard suites to allocate?</p><p>

Pretty amazing upgrade though!</p></div>

App was showing standard suite available, but front desk wouldn�t give it to me. Had to fight for the upgrade to deluxe too. Deluxe room was nice and large, club lounge was meh.</p></div>

		<p>It was great! It's not a true suite in that it's one very large room but that was not an issue for me. I was on the 15th floor and had a nice view of the garden below and the rooftops of Recoleta above. Their other standard suite is the Park One Bedroom which does have 2 rooms separated by a door but the overall space is smaller (61 square meters vs. 72 for the Park Suite).</p>

Upgrades can be done mid-stay. If this was the goal would�ve asked at check in as usually they would be more accommodating. I�ve had it offered several times saying none were available at check in but would be available the next day.</p><p>

However, any upgrades done beyond the day of check in are at the property�s discretion.</p></div>

</div><p>Tokyo and Paris were doing you a favor with the mid-stay upgrade since as already noted there is no obligation to upgrade mid-stay.  And PH Sydney is not known as a particularly elite generous property.  </p><p>

IMO there's nothing wrong with properties adhering to the rules, so long as they do that in both directions.</p></div>

According to Hyatt, "Globalists will receive the best room available at the time of check-in at Hyatt hotels and resorts, including Standard Suites and rooms with Club lounge-access."

It�s spreading across many hyatt properties that standard suites magically get dirty if you are a globalist trying to get an upgrade but available if you pay cash 🤔 If the app shows the room upgrade for sale for your stay after standard hotel check in time they need to honor it. Or you know, remove the rooms from inventory. </p><p>

I agree that if I was trying to check in early or something then it�s a whole different story. Or if it was right at checkin and they asked me to wait while they cleaned it from previous late checkout.</p></div>

</div><p>But not to worry, they made a big deal about having a very important personalized letter waiting for me. So much so that they also left a "text message" on the phone that I had to call the front desk to get (who didnt pick up for a long time) reminding me about the importance of said letter. It was a generic welcome letter. Nothing else. At least the view from the balcony is quite nice.</p></div>

</div><p>They replied to my survey feedback pretty aggressively saying that their records show they didn't have any "junior suites" available for upgrade during my stay and I should have used a suite upgrade award to confirm into a "premium suite". This is funny because according to their own site there are no suites classified or called junior suites at the property as the 1 bedroom suite is the standard suite, but also that suite upgrade awards can't be used to confirm premium suites. </p><p>

The assistant manager had no answers when questioned about what they meant by "available" since its pretty clear they would happily have taken a cash booking for the standard suite during my stay, but purposely make them unavailable for Globalist upgrades. Not surprising as he didn't even know the hotel doesn't have junior suites.</p></div>

</div><p> Yeah, I was very surprised. Especially since the parking lot has been nearly full every night, though I'm not sure how much of that is Park and Fly traffic. I didn't even have to ask at check-in, she just said "Would you like an upgrade to a King Suite?"</p></div>

</div><p>Well, had I received upgrades at the rate you all do, then my results, even out of 3 stays, would be higher. 33 percent is quite far off from the 90-100 percent seen by other posters. All of my stays are one-night stays, so upgrades should be easier for hotels to provide to me rather than more difficult.</p></div>

</div><p>I'm 8/11 since December 1.  The misses were HR Seattle (twice), where no suites were available (I book the corner king, which is a very nice room), and HR SFO, where I've never gotten one.  I excluded GH Berlin, where I booked a suite on cash.  Also excluded two SLH stays, though we were upgraded to a suite at Narcisse Blanc in Paris (lovely stay, probably best ever in Paris).  </p><p>

Perhaps more significantly, I've not had any "I'd like to speak with the manager" check-in moments with Hyatt.  Which I just had at Westin St. Francis last week (resulting in FDM very reluctantly putting me in a suite).</p></div>

</div><p>On the 2nd one, it sounds like they booked a suite at the Alila Napa Valley either through a TSU or direct points and then received a room (Corner Vineyard View is listed in the rooms category, not the suites category, on the website) - so my take is that they were downgraded below what they booked? As for the GH, the hotel has no reason to be so condescending.</p></div>

		<div><p>I was just saying Alila Napa used to offer Vineyard View Suite or Jr. Suite (Corner King) using Suite Upgrade Award, but they changed that to Farmhouse Suite which is sad. I thought my room was going to be Jr. Suite when I booked this about a year ago because that’s what I always received previously, but I found out it was actually the farmhouse when I called the hotel back in Nov.  I was happy that I got Jr. Suite at check-in, though.</p><p>

</div><p>Agreed as OP stays frequently at HR Churchill. It's a shame that Hyatt doesn't have tier differentiation beyond Globalist to reward those who spend a lot of time trying out different Hyatt properties and different parts of the world with increased suite upgrade priority. What is the point of being loyal to Hyatt as a chain (even spending most of the year in different Hyatts) if Globalist status doesn't get you upgrades at new-to-you properties? At that point, it's property loyalty over Hyatt loyalty, and that's an issue in the program in my opinion.</p></div>

</div><p>Don't get me wrong - I'm a solo traveler - suites are nice, but I don't have to have them. For example, I still enjoy my Hilton stays despite having not received a suite upgrade, and I'll continue to stay with them when it makes sense. My problem is that some claim to receive 90 to 100 percent suite upgrade success with Hyatt, which is so far off from my experience that I truly do think that there is some sort of negative note in my profile.</p></div>

</div><p>You can also be a regular to both specific hotels and to Hyatt as a whole?</p><p>

Back to my case yes I'm a regular at PHV and Churchill (only one where I had a stay without suite upgrade as hotel was full) but was also upgraded at the Andaz London (first stay) and Andaz Munich (only on previous stay in 2018). So year to date I fell pretty well treated by my usual hotels as well as by new ones (ie WoH).</p><p>

But I agree with you that it hasn't always have been the case and this year hit ratio is (for me) much higher than previous years of Globalist?</p></div>

</div><p>Unclear why being a fan of Marriott is bewildering - they have one of the best global footprints, and I'm consistently treated well as an Ambassador (welcome gifts, suite upgrades if available) - at both return properties as well as properties I am visiting for the first time.

Proportionally, Hyatt has disappointed me more with the lack of welcome gifts, resistance to upgrades, and rude on-property treatment.

</div><p>I do think that part of this conundrum comes down to expectations based on the experiences of others - I constantly see Hyatt getting praised on here and am thus disappointed when my own experiences don't match. Many on FlyerTalk hate Marriott, but my experiences are great, so I stay very happy. I've done 3 stays with Hilton this year and have four more planned. I went in with such low expectations based on online discourse and have been pleasantly surprised with the service and nice Gold / Diamond welcome gifts I have gotten.</p><p>

I know it's illogical to base your feelings off of comparison to others online, but I can't help it.</p></div>

</div><p>Fully agreed.  Marriott benefits were poor before the SPG takeover.  As was the mix of low end vs high end properties.  They got some of the best parts of Starwood (LC, StR, some better W and LMs out there, etc) but the program declines were obvious to us all in 2019 once the Capuano anti-guest, pro-owner attitudes came clear.  </p><p>

The fact that the near universal consensus on $23k Ambassador spend is �definitely not worth it�, as well as Titanium only better than Platinum for the UA Silver status, tells you everything you need to know about the Bonvoy program.</p></div>

</div><p>You are entitled to a suite if one is available at checkin.  Some hotels will pre-upgrade you, but not that far in advance.</p><p>

People who get upgraded to a suite 90 to 100% of the time are traveling to hotels that are not selling their suites -- that's it.  Right now hotel occupancy is so high that I am not sure where they are going but at slower times this is not surprising.  I often check to see what's available when I'm about to check in and I've never not gotten a suite when one was available.  This used to be a regular occurrence... not so much now.</p><p>

There are also some hotels that will upgrade globalists to premium suites when they are available, and some that won't.  This really has nothing to do with the program -- it's just the hotel going above and beyond.  It's definitely not something that you should expect.</p><p>

Welcome gifts for globalists are no longer a program benefit (they used to be) but many hotels still do this.  Again, it's just the hotel going above and beyond.</p><p>

I'm at the HR Osaka right now -- it's my first time here (nice hotel; horrible location).  No suite (there were never any suites available, even when I booked, never mind when I checked in) but they put me on the 27th floor (I'm unclear is this is the top floor with rooms, or if there are also rooms on the 28th floor where the lounge is) in a deluxe room.  This is definitely an upgrade, even though it's not a suite.  And I paid 35,500 pts for 5 nights (averaging 7100 pts/night), when the rate was about $210/night after taxes and fees.  THAT's the value of the program for me.</p></div>

I'm bewildered why people would stay at Hyatt if they are disappointed w the program especially when they're not disappointed elsewhere. I'm disappointed at Marriott so don't stay often. </p><p>

if Hyatt works for you, stay at Hyatt. If Marriott works for you, stay at Marriott<br>
I miss Marriotts footprint. But the last time I stayed at a LC the staff told me 70% of guests were elites. When everyone's an elite, no one is. Then what's the point of loyalty <br>

That being said, my current credit card situation has my WOH Chase Visa being the best Visa card that I possess, and as many international dining venues are reluctant or unable to take Amex and my Chase Visa is the best return for land transportation costs I have, I do put some spend on the card, earning me points. In addition, I'll have the yearly Cat 1-4 certificate. At this point, I see no reason to cancel the card, and all of my stays this year have been on points or certificates with my base points totaling 98 from a room service order at Andaz Capital Gate Abu Dhabi.</p></div>

I have several hundred nights at this property, but a recent hiatus. Emailed recently askingk for my usual blocked room <i>or if a suite is available one that has windows or doors that can be opened </i>(many do).</p><p>

Received an email from the Assistant FOM stating they don't upgrade in advance or guarantee a specific room. For five and a half  years I was allocated one of three specific rooms or the Ambassador, Diplomatic or Terrace Suites. Was shocked at the response.</p><p>

Of course, come check in day and I've been allocated a Deluxe that isn't one of the three numbers. Called Hyatt Glob line and the hotel argued with them. Fired off an email to the Assistant FOM and copied in Consumer Affairs. Immediately upgraded to a suite and they emailed me back somehow arguing <i>We were trying to honour your specific room number request</i> which is a lie.</p></div>

I night paid, upgraded to a Suite. Suite was weird - just one large sparsely furnished room. Bathroom was however gigantic. It was just an overnight so i really didn't care. Don't bother with TSUs here... not worth it imo.</p><p>

For those wondering, Grand Hyatt Manila is leaps and bounds better than the Hyatt Regency City of Dreams. Anything other than an overnighter to catch a flight - recommend the Grand Hyatt (which is a lovely hotel with a very nice lounge)</p></div>

</div><p>That's the upgrade we got too. Which is sort of my point. Here, both of us were upgraded, yet the property has specifically chosen to opt-out of upgrade ability via TSUs. Yet, they are giving upgrades to Globalists. This seems weird to me. I would assume a property who made a conscious choice to not participate with TSUs would be quite stingy with upgrades yet here we see 2 instances of them upgrading Globalists.  My question still remains, if this is allowed by WoH then why doesn't every property just opt out and give out upgrades when and if they feel like it?  Does City of Dreams get dinged in any way for opting out?</p></div>

</div><p>True that the leaving room is double the size (and wooden floor) and larger/nicer bathroom as well. <br>
But slightly smaller bedroom and view on the air conditioning and fire exits at the back of the building can�t compete with the balcony on Portman square/Nobu hotel�so all in all I think I prefer �my� usual corner balcony suite?</p></div>

1 night<br>
Booked: King Bed Garden View<br>
Upgraded: Studio Coastline View with Firepit<br>
There was a standard suite (One Bedroom Suite with Ocean View) available on app when I checked in but the FD said it’s not available. They said that the studio was a suite.  Got a 4pm late check-out, though.  </p><p>

<b>Grand Hyatt Vail:</b><br>
1 night<br>
Booked: Standard King<br>
Upgraded: Grand Suite | King Bed<br>
I got upgraded to the suite the day before checking in. The room was very nice, but this one didn’t have a bath tub. (I had one on my previous stay.)  Much easier to get a suite upgrade than the PH Beaver Creek.  Seemed there were at least 9 Grand Suite | King Bed rooms available when I checked in.</p></div>

(Unfortunately the incredibly generous Healthcare (COVID appreciation) Friends and Family rate seems to have ended at all Hyatt properties.)</p><p>

<b>Hyatt Regency Miami</b> (~$150/night): morning of check-in the app stated “Miami Suite” (which is preferential to a Panorama Suite which has worse views and no dresser, just what looks like a dresser with door enclosed shelves, although it does have a walk-in bathroom with a door). Miami Suite bathroom has sink &amp; vanity &amp; closet behind a partition with shower &amp; commode in a small room with a door (as pictured on the website).</p><p>

<b>Grand Hyatt Washington DC </b>(~$200/night): morning of check-in the app stated “1 King Bed Club Access”, suites noted to be available for last 2 of my 3 nights, asked at check-in, agent “blocked” an “Executive King Suite” for the last 2 nights, changed rooms after the first night.</p><p>

<b>Hyatt Regency Houston Galleria </b>(~$125/night): morning of check-in the app stated “Regency Suite King”, was assigned a 3rd floor (of 14 or 15) suite which turned out to be ADA/accessible with a massive roll-in shower stall missing one wall, asked for different suite, front desk supervisor didn’t know the difference between an ADA and non-ADA room/suite, I had to show him the 3rd floor suite and then look at the same non-ADA suite on the 10th floor (carpet being dried due to a leak) for him to see the differences, then took him 20-30 minutes to find me a Regency Suite King on the 8th floor (which has a large glass shower stall with a door and a ledge in a large bathroom as pictured on the website).</p><p>

<b>Hyatt Regency Chicago</b> (downtown)(~$150/night): afternoon of check-in the app stated “1 King City View Premium”, called from LYFT from airport at about 4pm, spoke with a front desk agent who actually works in the office behind the front desk, asked about suite upgrade, took a few minutes, she said she could put me in a suite on the 3rd floor (of 35), then she said she found a “River View Suite Premium” (with “a separate sleeping room with a door”) on the 14th floor.</p></div>

		<div><p>Just about to re-qualify as a Globalist and Hyatt has been very generous to me so far this year.</p><p>

All leisure trips typically booked the lowest or second lowest level room. Typical length of stay 3 � 6 nights.</p><p>



 <b>HR Yokohama</b>: Regency Suite (TSU)</p><p>

<b>Centric Kanazawa</b>: City View Suite (TSU)</p><p>

<b>HR Kyoto</b>: Balcony Deluxe</p><p>

<b>GH Melbourne</b>: Grand Suite</p><p>

<b>Centric Melbourne</b>: King Suite</p><p>

<b>GH Amman</b>: Regency Suite</p><p>

<b>GH Kuwait </b>(points stay): Grand Club Suite</p><p>

<b>PH Melbourne</b> (3 stays): 2 Deluxe View and 1 Park Suite.  The Deluxe View is my preferred option.</p><p>

<b>PH Doha</b>: Park Suite</p><p>

<b>GH Abu Dhab</b>i: Grand Suite King</p><p>

<b>GH Dubai</b>: Grand Suite</p><p>

<b>HR Dubai</b>: Regency Executive Suite</p><p>

<b>Andaz Singapore</b>: 1 King Bed with City View</p><p>

<b>PH Auckland</b>: Harbour View with Rooftop Balcony</p><p>

<b>Hyatt Place Caribbean Gardens</b> (Melbourne): High Floor Mountain View (Highest Room Category)</p><p>



 So very appreciative of Hyatt for really looking after me so far this year with significant upgrades on 62 of 64 Nights with Andaz Singapore being the only outlier.</p></div>

</div><p>It all depends on what the "standard suite" is at the property. For some properties, it is indeed a junior suite (which usually isn't a suite at all). For some hotels, the standard suite is clearly stated in the room description. When it's not, one way to try to determine it is to perform a points search and see what suites show for the standard suite price. The other way is to call Hyatt and ask.</p><p>

Hyatt needs to do better in identifying the standard suite type.</p></div>

</div><p>Another SPG loyalist here. Earned my LT Platinum status with SPG with paid stays. Marriott devalued the program to such an extent that I was staying exclusively at Hyatt as a lowly Explorist until last year, rather than choose Marriott as a Platinum elite. Of course I would have to stay with other properties regardless of brand/status in locations where Hyatt didn't have a presence.  Enjoying my Globalist status with WoH this last year and the loyalty recognition is definitely on par with the good ol' SPG Platinum days. So long Bonvoy!</p></div>

</div><p>GHA Discovery is the other program I’m putting a lot of stays through these days for exactly that reason. Elite benefits are certainly not comparable to Hyatt and most of the properties are in Asia / Middle East / Europe so not the easiest if you are US based, but the properties skew overwhelmingly five star (including ultra luxury like Capella) and they have quite a lot of good offers. It’s basically SPG without the Platinum treatment. Nice compliment to Hyatt also geographically.</p></div>

Whether I book the room I want (which I do), whether Hyatt is fairly marketing the benefits, and whether Hyatt is being "generous" are three completely separate questions.</p><p>

Upgrades are not guaranteed in the sense that availability may very well run out at check-in, but Hyatt does not like to advertise their definition of "available" as well as they advertise about Globalist benefits, in order to increase loyalty and business. If they advertised the benefit as "whatever the property feels like, including nothing, even when rooms are wide open", I'd suspect a lot less loyalty and business as a result.</p></div>

</div><p>What is available <i>is</i> defined in the terms, as posted earlier. It does sound like it's whatever the property feels like, including nothing, even when rooms are wide open. But clearly many hotels go above and beyond that limited definition. </p><p>

<span>"</span><span>(c) </span><b><u>Best Room Available</u></b><span>: Globalists will receive the best room available at the time of check-in at Hyatt hotels and resorts, including Standard Suites and rooms with Club lounge-access. <b>The best room available will be determined by the applicable hotel or resort in its sole discretion and may vary from stay-to-stay. The �best room� may, but will not necessarily be, of a room type/category higher than that booked by the Member."</b></span></p></div>

Two conclusions from this vacation: 1) If you book a Premium Suite as a Glob, you are unlikely to get a higher category suite even if available (this is not required under the T/Cs so is fair. 2) If you book Hyatt Prive allow enough time for the property to confirm your upgrade.
